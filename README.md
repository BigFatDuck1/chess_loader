There are basically no features in this. You can't even move the pieces.

Built with Godot - feel free to download Godot and compile it yourself to any platform you want. Simply create a new .json following the format in the `Database` folder and you can load the app with your own problems. 

WORK IN PROGRESS - once I have compiled a good amount of mating nets I will upload a version of web version of this onto Github pages
